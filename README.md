# DevControlMCP

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: This project is originally based on the [wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP) project. It started as a telemetry-free version and has been transformed into a full fork, the main difference is that it is telemetry free and the license will always be MIT. no new features or anything, actually we will probably be behind the main version and we may strip some features down to keep the bare minimum and avoid tool bloating.  but no telmetry. no license change.

## Overview
